    Helloo humans !<br> Nice to see you there. <br> So, as much as we're concerned you love cats. And that's
    understandable.
    We are amazing hunters, therapists, singers, runners, so cute and intelligent.<br> No wonder you can't resist us.
    <br>
    Not everything is roses though. <br> We are also the same
    creatures that doesn't let you sleep through the night, the ones zooming around
    when you need peace and quiet, but never around when you call our names.<br> Unless we're hungry of course. <br>
    Yep, we are cats. <br> And there's nothing<br> you can do about it. <br> <br>
    Let me introduce our cat-family. <br><span class="purple">Milka</span>
    is the center of our cat-universe. She is everywhere and dictates the rules. Having a white fur and being
    a princess she is means<br> grooming is her hobby.<br><span class="white">White</span>
    is also white (humans probably were too lazy to come up with a proper name, so called him a colour. <br>Very
    clever...)<br>
    You would think he is Milka's brother as they look the same! Actually, most of humans mix them up all the time,
    and that's because of their weak senses. We can smell each other from far away so usually we don't have such
    problems. <br>In
    reality,
    White is not Milka's relative. But you know who is? <br><span class="ginger">Garfield </span>!
    They have the same mum but live in different houses. And they couldn't be different from each other.
    <br>
    This
    kind-hearted ginger cat is absolute opposite to Milka. <br> <br>
    Now that you know who we are,<br> let's meet face-to-face. <br><br> Prepare for cuteness overload.
