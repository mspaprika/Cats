        Hello my friends! Welcome to my corner. I hope you'll enjoy my pictures as much as I do :) <br>
        There's a short story about me. <br>
        I am a house cat born in November 2020, so I should be like...2 years old. Fix me if I'm wrong. I'm a cat so
        calculating
        is just not my thing. <br> I like hunting flies and mosquitos, sleeping and playing with toys. But there is one
        thing
        I really love. Its pushing various things off the edges. You would not believe how much fun it is! Try it some
        time
        and you'll see. <br>
        Just because I'm a house cat doesn't mean I don't enjoy outside world. In fact, I enjoy it even too much, to the
        point where my humans have to put harness on my neck so I would not escape to the wild. That's annoying but I
        just can't help myself. As soon as I feel
        fresh air in my nose I cannot control myself anymore. I climb fences and even roofs. You would not expect a
        house
        cat to be that cool :) <br>
        My most favourite thing in the world? <br> Oh.. there's so many I cannot decide. Chasing flies? Or that red dot?
        sometimes
        all I need is that bright shadow on the wall (whatever it is). If you have some empty boxes, then we have a
        deal.
        It doesn't have to be empty though. Its easily fixable. If you want to see more about boxes...
        <a href="boxes.html">go here!</a> <br>
        I think I know finally my favourite thing. And its....being the center of attention! I can't be the only one
        like this, right?
        <br><br>
        But there is a little secret about me. One minute I can be the cutest thing in the world. The other I will be
        chasing
        you around the house (as if you could escape from me :) and you will notice this evil look on my face.
        My humans think I have double personality but for me it's just a life. <br> <br>
        But sometimes I can't shake a feeling that they might be right. <br>
        What do YOU think ?
