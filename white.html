    Hello human friends. <br> I am called White for the sake of simplicity, but my real name is even worse. <br>
    My first owners called me Kat which is right, I mean I am cat. Who would argue with that? <br> But honestly, humans,
    I feel you could do better with this. <br> Why not use a bit of imagination when deciding your pet's names. Just
    saying..
    <br> But that's ok with me. Let me tell you about myself. <br>
    I have a calm and friendly personality which is really helpful to make human friends. But it is not that helpful
    with other more agressive local cats. I get into fights and that's just not my thing... <br> I could hide inside my
    house,
    you would say. But it's not that simple when there's 3 toddlers living in the same house. <br> If there's a choice
    between 3 toddlers and being eaten by wolves... I'm choosing wolves. <br>
    This is how I became outdoor cat. <br> It's not always comfy here outside but I never regret this decision. <br>
    Being
    a friendly cat I am, I made sure I never go hungry as there's always a human to feed me. <br> I am able to enjoy
    some priviliges of a house cat and at the same time enjoy freedom. <br> <br>
    When it comes to Milka, situation is a bit complicated. <br> She's not my type but that doesn't bother me. If she
    wasn't so boisterous maybe we could be even friends... <br>
    Probably she just doesn't want to share a spotlight with me.<br> This is so silly. <br>
    I am wise enough to stay away from her. I think you should too! <br> <br>
    Here are some cute moments I want to share with you. <br>
    Enjoy!
